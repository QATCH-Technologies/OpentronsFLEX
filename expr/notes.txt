Failed to initialize character device, will not be able to control gpios (lights, button, smoothiekill, smoothie reset). Only one connection can be made to the gpios at a time. If you need to control gpios, first stop the robot server with systemctl stop opentrons-robot-server. Until you restart the server with systemctl start opentrons-robot-server, you will be unable to control the robot using the Opentrons app.
This is intended to run on a robot, and while it can connect to a smoothie via a usb/serial adapter unexpected things using gpios (such as smoothie reset or light management) will fail. If you are seeing this message and you are running on a robot, you need to set the RUNNING_ON_PI environmental variable to 1.
Failed to initiate aionotify, cannot watch modules or door, likely because not running on linux
